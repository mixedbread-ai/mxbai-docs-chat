## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun (or Node.js 22+)
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-docs-chat
cd mxbai-docs-chat
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your credentials to the `.env` file:

```env
MXBAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
MXBAI_STORE_ID=your-store-id
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token-here
```

**To get your API key and Store ID, you have two options:**

1. **From Vercel Integration** (Recommended if deploying to Vercel):
   - Go to your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Navigate to your project's **Integrations** tab
   - Install or access the [Mixedbread integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/mixedbread)
   - Copy your API key and Store ID from the integration settings

2. **From Mixedbread Platform** (For standalone use):
   - Visit the [Mixedbread Platform](https://platform.mixedbread.com/platform?next=api-keys)
   - Sign up or log in to your account
   - Navigate to **API Keys** and create a new key
   - Navigate to **Stores** and create a new Store, then copy the Store ID

### 4. Upload Documentation Files to Store

This script fetches the Next.js documentation from GitHub and uploads it to your Mixedbread Store for semantic search:

```bash
bun ingest-docs
```

> **Note**: By default, this ingests Next.js documentation from the official repository. See the [Customization](#customization) section below to index your own documentation.

### 5. Run the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

## Customization

### Using Your Own Documentation

To index your own documentation instead of Next.js docs, modify `scripts/ingest-docs.ts`:

1. **Change the repository settings**:
```typescript
const REPO_OWNER = "your-org";
const REPO_NAME = "your-repo";
const REPO_BRANCH = "main"; // or your default branch
const DOCS_PATH = "docs"; // path to your docs folder
```

2. **Update the source URL construction** in the `constructSourceUrl()` function to match your documentation site structure.

3. **Adjust file extensions** if needed:
```typescript
const VALID_EXTENSIONS = [".md", ".mdx"]; // add other formats if needed
```

4. Run the ingestion script:
```bash
bun ingest-docs
```

### Alternative: Upload Local Documentation Files

If want to upload your local documentation files, you can use the [Mixedbread CLI](https://www.mixedbread.com/cli) to upload them directly to your Store.

### Customizing the LLM Behavior

Edit `app/api/chat/route.ts` to customize:
- **System Prompt**: Modify the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant to change the LLM's behavior and instructions
- **Model**: Change the `model` variable if you want to use a different LLM
